2. **Test sensors**:
   - Place object 2 feet in front of mower
   - Verify distance reading is approximately correct
   - Move object to 1 foot, 3 feet - readings should update
3. **Set sensitivity**:
   - **High sensitivity**: Stops for small objects (recommended)
   - **Medium sensitivity**: Ignores very small objects
   - **Low sensitivity**: Only stops for large obstacles

**Camera Setup**:
1. **Verify camera feed**: Should show clear image from mower's perspective
2. **Adjust settings if needed**:
   - **Brightness**: Adjust for lighting conditions
   - **Contrast**: Enhance object visibility
   - **Focus**: Should be automatic, but can be manual if needed

### Battery System Configuration

**Charging Configuration**:
- **Solar panel efficiency**: Monitor charging rate in full sun
- **Charge controller settings**: Verify appropriate for your battery type
- **Charging schedule**: Set preferred charging times if needed

## Step 3: Yard Mapping and Boundaries

### Create Your Mowing Boundary

**‚ö†Ô∏è Important**: This is the most critical setup step. Take your time and be precise.

**Preparation**:
1. **Plan your route**: Walk around your property and plan the boundary path
2. **Stay inside obstacles**: Maintain 3-4 feet clearance from:
   - Fences and walls
   - Flower beds and gardens
   - Trees and large shrubs
   - Permanent outdoor furniture
   - Driveways and walkways
3. **Consider safety zones**: Extra clearance around:
   - Play equipment
   - Pet areas
   - Frequently used paths

**Boundary Definition Process**:
1. **Go to Mapping page** (üó∫Ô∏è icon in sidebar)
2. **Start boundary definition**:
   - Click "Start Boundary Definition"
   - Choose starting point (usually near home position)
3. **Walk the boundary**:
   - Walk slowly (2-3 mph) around perimeter
   - Stay consistent distance from obstacles
   - GPS will record your path as green line on map
   - Take your time - accuracy is important
4. **Complete boundary**:
   - Return to starting point
   - Click "Complete Boundary" when path connects
   - System will show total area and boundary length

**Boundary Tips**:
- **Walk the same path twice** for better accuracy
- **Avoid walking during GPS poor conditions** (cloudy, near buildings)
- **Include slopes less than 20 degrees** only
- **Create wide turns** - avoid sharp corners that are hard to mow
- **Consider seasonal changes** - leave room for plant growth

### Set Home Position

**Choose Home Location**:
- **Near power source**: Should be close to charging setup
- **Protected area**: Covered or sheltered location preferred
- **Easy access**: For maintenance and manual operation
- **Level ground**: Avoid slopes for charging stability

**Set Home Position**:
1. **Position mower** at desired home location
2. **Verify GPS accuracy** (should be < 2 meters)
3. **Click "Set Home Position"** in mapping interface
4. **Confirm location**: Home marker should appear at correct spot

### Define No-Go Zones

**Identify Areas to Avoid**:
- Flower beds and vegetable gardens
- Sprinkler heads and irrigation equipment
- Decorative objects and lawn art
- Play equipment and outdoor furniture
- Steep slopes (>20 degrees)
- Wet or soft areas
- Property boundaries requiring precision

**Create No-Go Zones**:
1. **In Mapping page**: Click "Add No-Go Zone"
2. **Draw zone boundary**:
   - Click points around area to avoid
   - Include adequate buffer space
   - Close polygon by clicking first point again
3. **Name and save zone**: Give descriptive name for easy identification
4. **Test boundary**: Use simulation mode to verify mower avoids area

## Step 4: Mowing Configuration

### Choose Initial Mowing Pattern

**Pattern Selection Guidelines**:

**For Large, Open Areas**:
- **Primary**: Parallel pattern (most efficient)
- **Secondary**: Checkerboard for best cut quality
- **Avoid**: Random pattern (inefficient for large areas)

**For Complex or Irregular Yards**:
- **Primary**: Spiral pattern (handles irregular shapes well)
- **Secondary**: Random pattern (natural appearance)
- **Consider**: Breaking into zones with different patterns

**For Mixed Terrain**:
- **Primary**: Checkerboard (thorough coverage)
- **Secondary**: Parallel with high overlap
- **Consider**: Manual pattern selection for problem areas

### Set Mowing Parameters

**Speed Settings**:
- **Start with**: 1.0 m/s (moderate speed)
- **Increase to**: 1.5 m/s if cut quality is good
- **Decrease to**: 0.8 m/s for thick grass or uneven terrain
- **Maximum**: 2.0 m/s only for smooth, open areas

**Cutting Height**:
- **Spring**: Higher setting (3-4 inches) for initial cuts
- **Summer**: Medium setting (2.5-3 inches) for regular maintenance
- **Fall**: Gradually lower for final cuts
- **Rule**: Never cut more than 1/3 of grass height in single pass

**Overlap Settings**:
- **Standard**: 15% overlap between passes
- **High quality**: 20% overlap for thick or uneven grass
- **Efficient**: 10% overlap for regular maintenance
- **Problem areas**: Up to 25% overlap if needed

### Safety Configuration

**Obstacle Detection**:
- **Sensitivity**: Start with "High" setting
- **Stopping distance**: 0.5 meters from obstacles
- **Override capability**: Disable for advanced users only

**Weather Monitoring**:
- **Rain detection**: Enable automatic rain stopping
- **Wind limits**: Stop operation in winds >20 mph
- **Temperature limits**: 40-85¬∞F operating range
- **Forecast monitoring**: Check weather 2 hours ahead

**Emergency Systems**:
- **Tilt detection**: Enable automatic stop if lifted/tilted
- **Emergency contact**: Set phone number for alerts
- **Automatic return**: Enable low-battery return home
- **Communication loss**: Return home if lose connection >5 minutes

## Step 5: Create Your First Schedule

### Basic Schedule Setup

**Determine Mowing Frequency**:
- **Grass growth rate**: Varies by season and grass type
- **Typical residential**: 3-4 times per week during growing season
- **Large properties**: Daily mowing may be needed
- **Low-maintenance**: 2 times per week minimum

**Choose Mowing Days**:
- **Recommended**: Monday, Wednesday, Friday (every other day)
- **Daily option**: Monday-Saturday (rest on Sunday)
- **Weekend option**: Saturday and Sunday only
- **Custom**: Based on your schedule and grass growth

**Set Time Windows**:
- **Start time**: When mowing can begin (consider noise ordinances)
- **End time**: When mowing must stop (before evening activities)
- **Typical window**: 9:00 AM - 5:00 PM
- **Quiet neighborhood**: 10:00 AM - 3:00 PM

### Create Your Schedule

1. **Go to Scheduler page** (üìÖ icon)
2. **Click "Create New Schedule"**
3. **Configure schedule**:
   - **Name**: "Regular Maintenance" (or your preference)
   - **Days**: Select your chosen days
   - **Start time**: Your preferred start time
   - **End time**: Your preferred end time
   - **Pattern**: Your chosen mowing pattern
   - **Weather conditions**: Enable weather monitoring
4. **Save schedule**

**Example Schedule**:
```
Name: "Spring Maintenance"
Days: Monday, Wednesday, Friday
Time: 9:00 AM - 4:00 PM
Pattern: Parallel (rotate to checkerboard weekly)
Weather: Skip if rain within 2 hours
Speed: 1.0 m/s
```

### Test Your Schedule

**Schedule Verification**:
1. **Enable schedule**: Turn on your newly created schedule
2. **Check next run**: Verify next scheduled mowing time is correct
3. **Manual test**: Run a short manual mowing session first
