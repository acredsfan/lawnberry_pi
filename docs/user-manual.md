## Setting Up Your Yard

### Step 1: Define Your Mowing Area

Before your first mow, you need to define where the mower should operate:

1. **Go to Mapping page** (üó∫Ô∏è icon in sidebar)
2. **Ensure GPS lock**: Wait for "GPS: LOCKED" status (may take 2-5 minutes outdoors)
3. **Walk the boundary**:
   - Click "Start Boundary Definition"
   - Walk slowly around the perimeter of your lawn
   - Stay 3-4 feet inside any obstacles (fences, flower beds, etc.)
   - The map will show your path as a green line
   - Click "Complete Boundary" when you return to start

**üí° Tips for Boundary Setting**:
- Walk at normal pace (2-3 mph) for best GPS accuracy
- Stay consistent distance from obstacles
- Include buffer space for safety
- You can edit boundaries later if needed

### Step 2: Set No-Go Zones

Protect sensitive areas by creating no-go zones:

1. **In Mapping page**: Click "Add No-Go Zone"
2. **Draw on map**: Click points to create a polygon around areas to avoid
   - Flower beds and gardens
   - Play equipment or outdoor furniture  
   - Sprinkler heads
   - Slopes steeper than 20 degrees
   - Areas with loose objects
3. **Save zones**: Click "Save No-Go Zone" for each area

### Step 3: Set Home Position

Define where your mower should return for charging:

1. **Position mower** at desired home location (near power source)
2. **In Mapping page**: Click "Set Home Position"
3. **Verify location**: Ensure home marker appears at correct spot on map

## Mowing Operations
