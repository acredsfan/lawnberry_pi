# Implementation Gap Analysis

This document provides a detailed analysis of features specified in `plan.md` that have not yet been implemented, along with recommendations for future development priorities.

## High Priority Gaps

### 1. Google Maps Integration (Critical)

**Planned Features (from plan.md):**
- Google Maps JS API integration for yard visualization
- Interactive yard boundary setting via map interface
- No-go zone creation and editing on map
- Robot home location setting via map
- Mowing pattern visualization overlaid on map
- Real-time mowing progress tracking on map

**Current Status:**
- Environment variable placeholder exists (`REACT_APP_GOOGLE_MAPS_API_KEY`)
- Backend APIs for boundaries and no-go zones are implemented
- No frontend Google Maps integration exists

**Impact:**
- Users cannot visually set yard boundaries
- No intuitive way to define no-go zones
- Reduced user experience for non-technical users

**Implementation Effort:** High (estimated 2-3 weeks)

## Medium Priority Gaps

### 2. Advanced Mowing Patterns

**Planned Features (from plan.md):**
- Waves pattern
- Crosshatch pattern
- Additional pattern variations mentioned as "etc."

**Current Status:**
- 3 patterns implemented: Parallel Lines, Checkerboard, Spiral
- Backend pattern system supports adding new patterns
- Frontend pattern selection interface exists

**Impact:**
- Limited mowing pattern variety
- Reduced optimization options for different yard shapes

**Implementation Effort:** Low-Medium (estimated 1 week)

### 3. Google Coral TPU Integration

**Planned Features (from plan.md):**
- Enhanced obstacle detection and identification
- Improved computer vision processing
- USB connection integration

**Current Status:**
- Not implemented
- Standard OpenCV vision processing in use
- Camera system functional without TPU acceleration

**Impact:**
- Reduced vision processing performance
- Less sophisticated obstacle identification
- Acceptable for basic operation

**Implementation Effort:** Medium (estimated 2 weeks)

## Low Priority Gaps

### 4. RC Control System

**Planned Features (from plan.md):**
- Optional RC control via RoboHAT and external RC receiver
- Manual override capability

**Current Status:**
- Not implemented
- RoboHAT communication exists but no RC integration

**Impact:**
- No manual remote control option
- Emergency control limited to software emergency stop

**Implementation Effort:** Medium (estimated 1-2 weeks)

### 5. Advanced Power Management

**Planned Features (from plan.md):**
- RP2040 power shutdown when battery low
- Automatic sunny spot seeking for charging

**Current Status:**
- Basic power monitoring implemented
- Low battery detection exists
- No automatic charging spot seeking

**Impact:**
- Manual intervention required for low battery situations
- Suboptimal charging efficiency

**Implementation Effort:** Medium-High (estimated 2-3 weeks)

## Future Enhancement Opportunities

### Smart Home Integration
- Home Assistant integration (mentioned in plan.md future additions)
- Mobile app development
- Voice control integration

### Advanced Analytics
- Mowing efficiency analytics
- Predictive maintenance
- Performance optimization based on usage patterns

### Enhanced Safety Features
- Person/pet recognition improvements
- Advanced weather prediction integration
- Geofencing with cellular backup

## Implementation Recommendations

### Phase 1: Critical User Experience (High Priority)
1. **Google Maps Integration** - Essential for professional user experience
2. **Advanced Mowing Patterns** - Quick win for feature completeness

### Phase 2: Performance Enhancements (Medium Priority)
3. **Google Coral TPU Integration** - Improve vision processing
4. **Advanced Power Management** - Enhance autonomous operation

### Phase 3: Optional Features (Low Priority)
5. **RC Control System** - Nice-to-have for manual control
6. **Smart Home Integration** - Market differentiation

## Development Impact Assessment

**Current State:** The system is highly functional and production-ready for autonomous mowing operations. The missing features primarily impact user experience and advanced functionality rather than core operation.

**User Impact:** The lack of Google Maps integration is the most significant user experience gap, especially for non-technical users who need visual boundary setting.

**Technical Debt:** The architecture is well-designed to accommodate the missing features without major refactoring.

**Resource Allocation:** Focus should be on Google Maps integration first, as it provides the highest user value return on development investment.
