"""VL53L0X Time-of-Flight distance sensor driver (T045).

Implements minimal async lifecycle using the HardwareDriver ABC. This is a
simulation-friendly stub that returns placeholder readings when SIM_MODE=1 or
hardware access libraries are unavailable on the current platform. The real
implementation will integrate with smbus2 for I2C transactions and perform
continuous ranging. For now we expose a single `read_distance_mm` method used
by SensorManager and future safety triggers (obstacle <0.2m â†’ emergency stop).

Platform / Constitution Notes:
- Safe on Pi 4B and Pi 5; avoids importing heavy I2C libs unless present.
- Falls back to deterministic pseudo-random distances in SIM_MODE to enable
  contract test evolution without real hardware.
- Keeps <5ms execution for health_check and read methods (no blocking I/O).
