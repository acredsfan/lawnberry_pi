# Agent Journal - LawnBerry Pi v2

## Session 2025-09-25 - Constitution Establishment & Agent Journal Requirement

**Agent**: GitHub Copilot  
**Start Time**: 2025-09-25  
**Objective**: Establish project constitution and add agent journal requirement

### Actions Taken
1. **Constitution Creation (v1.0.0)**
   - Created initial LawnBerry Pi Constitution from template
   - Established 5 core principles: Platform Exclusivity, Package Isolation, Test-First Development, Hardware Resource Coordination, Constitutional Hardware Compliance
   - Added Technology Stack Requirements, Development Workflow, and Governance sections
   - Set ratification date: 2025-09-25

2. **Constitution Amendment (v1.0.0 → v1.1.0)**
   - Added agent journal requirement to Development Workflow section
   - Updated version and last amended date
   - Updated plan template to reference v1.1.0

3. **Template Consistency**
   - Updated `.specify/templates/plan-template.md` to reference correct constitution version
   - Validated all templates for constitutional alignment

### Key Decisions Made
- **Platform Exclusivity**: Raspberry Pi OS Bookworm 64-bit only, no cross-platform support
- **Package Isolation**: Strict isolation for AI acceleration dependencies, banned pycoral/edgetpu in main env
- **Hardware Compliance**: Fixed INA3221 channel assignments per hardware.yaml
- **Agent Journal**: Required in .specify/memory/ for seamless handoffs

### Current Project State
- Constitution established at v1.1.0 with governance framework
- All template files updated and consistent
- Project follows autonomous robotic lawn mower specification with WebUI
- Constitutional compliance framework in place for future development

### Files Modified
- `.specify/memory/constitution.md` - Created and amended
- `.specify/templates/plan-template.md` - Updated version reference
- `.specify/memory/AGENT_JOURNAL.md` - Created (this file)

### Next Steps / TODOs
- None identified - constitution is complete and ready for development
- Future agents should continue journaling per constitutional requirement

### Notes for Handoff
- Constitution supersedes all other practices per Governance section
- All development must verify constitutional compliance
- Use `spec/agent_rules.md` for runtime development guidance
- TDD methodology is non-negotiable
- Hardware resource coordination is critical for multi-service system

## Session 2025-09-25 - CI Workflow Requirement Amendment

**Agent**: GitHub Copilot  
**Change**: Constitution v1.1.0 → v1.2.0  
**Summary**: Added requirement to run `.github/workflows/` after task completion and commit successful outputs.

### Actions Taken
1. Amended Development Workflow to mandate CI workflow execution post-tasks and committing results on success.
2. Updated version line and Sync Impact Report in constitution.
3. Updated `.specify/templates/plan-template.md` to reference v1.2.0.

### Rationale
Ensures consistent validation and capture of generated artifacts and documentation updates, improving reliability and handoff quality.

### Operator Notes
- If a workflow fails, do NOT commit broken artifacts. Document failures and remediation steps here and in PR.
- Use conventional commit messages referencing the workflows, e.g., `chore(ci): run workflows and commit generated docs`.

### Files Modified
- `.specify/memory/constitution.md` (v1.2.0)
- `.specify/templates/plan-template.md`

---

## Session 2025-09-25 - Agent Execution Rules Expansion

**Agent**: GitHub Copilot  
**Change**: Constitution v1.2.0 → v1.3.0  
**Summary**: Added mandatory agent execution rules (repo edits, tests/lint on ARM64, journaling, stop on incompatible dependencies, MCP tool usage for committing after workflows).

### Actions Taken
1. Expanded Development Workflow with explicit agent execution rules.
2. Updated constitution version to v1.3.0 and Sync Impact Report.
3. Propagated plan template footer to v1.3.0.

### Rationale
Ensure consistent, Pi-compatible execution with clear commit and review flows, improving reliability, auditability, and handoff quality.

### Operator Notes
- Always validate ARM64 availability of dependencies; propose Pi-compatible alternatives if unavailable.
- Run tests/lint locally on Raspberry Pi OS Bookworm when needed.
- Use `#mcp_github_add_comment_to_pending_review` for commit/push in workflows-based review processes.

### Files Modified
- `.specify/memory/constitution.md` (v1.3.0)
- `.specify/templates/plan-template.md` (v1.3.0)

---

## Session 2025-09-25 - Task Planning (/tasks)

**Agent**: GitHub Copilot  
**Branch**: 004-lawnberry-pi-v2  
**Objective**: Generate executable tasks.md from Phase 1 design docs following TDD and constitutional rules.

### Inputs
- Feature directory (from prerequisites): `/home/pi/lawnberry/specs/004-lawnberry-pi-v2`
- Available docs: `plan.md`, `research.md`, `data-model.md`, `contracts/`, `quickstart.md`
- Tasks template: `.specify/templates/tasks-template.md`

### Actions Taken
1. Ran `.specify/scripts/bash/check-prerequisites.sh --json` to resolve FEATURE_DIR and AVAILABLE_DOCS.
2. Loaded and analyzed design docs: extracted entities, endpoints, and scenarios.
3. Updated `tasks.md` to:
   - Mark integration tests as [P] where independent.
   - Enumerate each REST endpoint as its own implementation task (sequential within `rest.py`).
   - Renumber downstream tasks and update dependency ranges.
   - Add explicit Task agent command examples for parallel execution.
   - Add performance tests task and align constitutional checks.

### Output Artifacts
- Updated: `/home/pi/lawnberry/specs/004-lawnberry-pi-v2/tasks.md`

### Notes
- Tests are placed before implementation (contract + integration first).
- Parallel flags only on tasks in distinct files; REST endpoints remain sequential.
- Paths are absolute for immediate execution by task agents.

### Follow-ups
- Proceed to implementation (Phase 3) executing tasks in order; run CI workflows and update this journal per constitution.

## Session 2025-09-25 - Analysis Remediation Edits

**Agent**: GitHub Copilot  
**Branch**: 004-lawnberry-pi-v2  
**Objective**: Resolve issues found in /analyze: clarify weather integration, add NFRs, expand tasks for coverage.

### Changes Made
- spec.md: Added Non-Functional Requirements (NFR-001…NFR-010), clarified weather integration (BME280 + OpenWeatherMap), defined performance measurement, dead-reckoning bounds, caching strategies, WS resilience, auth hardening, offline maps behavior, systemd health checks, privacy/audit.
- tasks.md: Added Phase 3.8 tasks T081–T100 covering weather, caching, audit, backups/migration, auth hardening, WS reconnection, dead-reckoning tests, docs drift CI, systemd health, frontend auth/offline maps/docs hub, privacy/log rotation.
- quickstart.md: Added API key env vars, offline OSM fallback note, weather enablement, dead-reckoning validation step.

### Rationale
- Align with constitution (ARM64-only, no runtime Ethernet dependency) and close coverage gaps (FR-012, FR-017, FR-019, FR-020, FR-025, NFRs).

### Next Steps
- Execute tasks beginning with tests; ensure CI workflows pass; commit per constitution. Add caching/WS resilience contract tests before implementations.

- Created backend skeleton under `backend/src/` with packages for `api`, `services`, `models`, and a minimal `main.py` entrypoint.
- Added root `pyproject.toml` with pytest/ruff/black configuration (no duplicate sections).
- Created tests structure under `tests/{contract,integration,unit}/` and authored failing placeholders covering REST, WebSocket, core scenarios, edge cases, platform compliance, and migration.
- Added docs/constitution.md bootstrap.
- Updated tasks.md marking T001–T007 and T008–T015 as completed.

### Validation
- Ran `pytest`: 7 failing tests (expected for TDD), 1 passing placeholder (unit scaffold).

### Next Steps
