# Feature Specification: LawnBerry Pi v2 ‚Äì Hardware Integration & UI Completion

**Feature Branch**: `001-integrate-hardware-and`  
**Created**: 2025-09-28  
**Status**: Draft  
**Input**: User description: "Integrate the hardware and test that the readings are working, further polish the UI while keeping the branding (it's missing the map display where the user can set the home, am sun, pm sun, and draw a polygon for the yard boundaries for the robot to stay within on the maps page, the control page isn't working, and the settings page isn't loading), and complete all final documentation. The HW integration should include the fact that the RP2040 on the RoboHAT is running code.py and the hardware is wired as shown in hardware-feature-matrix.md and hardware-overview.md. Branding should follow LawnBerryPi_logo.png."

## Execution Flow (main)

## ‚ö° Quick Guidelines
- ‚úÖ Focus on WHAT users need and WHY
- ‚ùå Avoid HOW to implement (no tech stack, APIs, code structure)
- üë• Written for business stakeholders, not developers

### Section Requirements
- **Mandatory sections**: Must be completed for every feature
- **Optional sections**: Include only when relevant to the feature
- When a section doesn't apply, remove it entirely (don't leave as "N/A")

### For AI Generation
When creating this spec from a user prompt:
1. **Mark all ambiguities**: Use [NEEDS CLARIFICATION: specific question] for any assumption you'd need to make
2. **Don't guess**: If the prompt doesn't specify something (e.g., "login system" without auth method), mark it
3. **Think like a tester**: Every vague requirement should fail the "testable and unambiguous" checklist item
4. **Common underspecified areas**:
   - User types and permissions
   - Data retention/deletion policies  
   - Performance targets and scale
   - Error handling behaviors
   - Integration requirements
   - Security/compliance needs

## User Scenarios & Testing *(mandatory)*

### Primary User Story
A LawnBerry operator powers on a Raspberry Pi 5 mower equipped with the full constitutional hardware stack and accesses the LawnBerry-branded web interface to verify live telemetry, configure mowing bounds, issue commands, adjust settings, and review documentation before approving the production release.

### Acceptance Scenarios
1. **Given** the mower is running on Raspberry Pi OS Lite Bookworm with the RoboHAT RP2040 firmware active, **When** the operator opens the Dashboard, **Then** every sensor and power reading defined in `spec/hardware.yaml` streams in real time with healthy status indicators and validation against expected ranges. Drive is controlled via RoboHAT‚ÜíCytron; blade is controlled via IBT-4 GPIO.
2. **Given** the operator opens the Map Setup page, **When** they place Home, AM Sun, PM Sun markers and draw yard boundary polygons, **Then** the UI renders the LawnBerry-branded map, saves coordinates, and the backend acknowledges the updated navigation envelope.
3. **Given** the operator navigates to the Control page, **When** they issue manual drive, blade, and emergency commands, **Then** the mower responds within ‚â§250 ms on Raspberry Pi 5 (‚â§350 ms on Raspberry Pi 4B) while providing feedback, safety overrides, and telemetry confirmation (drive via RoboHAT, blade via IBT-4 GPIO).
4. **Given** the operator visits the Settings page, **When** the page loads, **Then** the complete configuration suite appears (hardware detection, network, telemetry cadence, simulation toggles) and changes persist after save and reload.
5. **Given** the operator reviews documentation from the Docs Hub, **When** they open Hardware Overview, Wiring, and Operations guides, **Then** the updated content reflects the verified hardware topology, firmware references, and branding assets.
6. **Given** a Raspberry Pi 4B is used as a compatibility check, **When** the system runs in graceful degradation mode, **Then** telemetry, UI pages, and documentation remain accessible with noted performance adjustments but no missing functionality.

### Edge Cases
- Hardware component temporarily offline or miswired: system flags degraded status, logs issue, and guides remediation without crashing UI.
- Loss of RTK corrections or GPS signal: map view and telemetry clearly indicate fallback behavior and prompt operator action.
- Missing LawnBerry branding asset on the frontend: build validation blocks deployment until required imagery/fonts are present.
- Remote control command issued during safety lockout: Control page rejects the command and surfaces the blocking condition.
- Documentation bundle accessed without network connectivity: Docs Hub serves offline-ready copies with clear refresh guidance.

## Requirements *(mandatory)*

### Functional Requirements
- **FR-001**: System MUST ingest and validate live telemetry from every hardware element documented in `spec/hardware.yaml`, `docs/hardware-overview.md`, and `docs/hardware-feature-matrix.md`, confirming expected ranges, calibration, and status for sensors, motors, power, and communication channels.
- **FR-002**: System MUST confirm that the RoboHAT RP2040 firmware (`robohat-rp2040-code/code.py`) is deployed, configured, and reporting drive, encoder, and safety data to the backend with watchdog health monitoring. Blade control is provided via IBT-4 GPIO driver with mirrored status in telemetry.
- **FR-003**: System MUST surface power metrics (battery, solar, INA3221 channels) in the Dashboard with alerts for out-of-bound readings and data export for diagnostics.
- **FR-004**: System MUST display GPS, RTK correction, and IMU orientation data with health badges, including fallback messaging when RTK converges slowly or drops out.
- **FR-005**: System MUST verify ROS/IPC or equivalent message topics deliver ToF, environmental, and camera telemetry at the constitutional cadence (default 5 Hz configurable 1‚Äì10 Hz) without data loss.
- **FR-006**: System MUST deliver the Map Setup experience with LawnBerry branding, marker placement (Home, AM Sun, PM Sun), polygon drawing for operational boundaries and exclusion zones, and persistence with server acknowledgement.
- **FR-007**: System MUST ensure the Control page provides responsive manual drive, blade, and emergency controls with safety interlocks, audit logging, and status mirroring (drive feedback from RoboHAT, blade status from IBT-4 GPIO driver).
- **FR-008**: System MUST restore the Settings page with comprehensive configuration categories (hardware, networking, telemetry, simulation, AI acceleration hierarchy) and enforce validation before saving.
- **FR-009**: System MUST confirm UI branding adherence using `LawnBerryPi_logo.png` (and related constitutional assets) across Dashboard, Map, Control, Settings, and Docs Hub, including responsive layout on Pi-mounted displays.
- **FR-010**: System MUST capture, organize, and publish final documentation: hardware wiring guides, firmware references, UI guides, operations manual, troubleshooting, and migration notes, all updated to match v1.5.0 constitutional mandates.
- **FR-011**: System MUST produce verification artifacts (test logs, screenshots, or recorded sessions) demonstrating hardware telemetry, UI flows, and documentation completeness for release review.
- **FR-012**: System MUST validate graceful degradation on Raspberry Pi 4B, documenting performance considerations, disabled embellishments (if any), and ensuring constitutional features remain available.
- **FR-013**: System MUST integrate compliance checks into CI to block deployment if telemetry tests fail, UI regressions occur, or documentation drift is detected.
- **FR-014**: System MUST provide operators with clear remediation guidance when hardware, telemetry, or UI components fail validation, referencing updated documentation.
- **FR-015**: System MUST maintain audit trails for configuration changes, control actions, and documentation updates to support release sign-off.
- **FR-016**: Dashboard telemetry updates MUST achieve ‚â§250 ms end-to-end latency on Raspberry Pi 5 (16 GB) during normal operation and maintain ‚â§350 ms latency when gracefully degraded on Raspberry Pi 4B.

### Key Entities *(include if feature involves data)*
- **Hardware Telemetry Stream**: Real-time dataset of sensor, power, and control values sourced from `spec/hardware.yaml` components and RoboHAT firmware, with health status, timestamps, and validation tags.
- **Map Configuration**: Geospatial definitions for Home, AM Sun, PM Sun, yard boundaries, exclusion zones, and map provider metadata stored per property.
- **Control Session**: Record of manual commands, safety overrides, and acknowledgements with linkage to telemetry snapshots and operator identity.
- **Settings Profile**: Persistent configuration set covering hardware detection, network credentials, telemetry cadence, simulation toggles, AI acceleration preferences, and branding compliance confirmations.
- **Documentation Bundle**: Curated collection of guides (hardware overview, feature matrix, wiring diagrams, operations, troubleshooting) with version tags, asset references, and offline availability indicators.
- **Verification Artifact**: Evidence package capturing test runs, UI walkthroughs, and validation outputs required for release approval and governance reviews.

## Clarifications
