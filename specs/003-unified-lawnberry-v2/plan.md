# LawnBerry Pi v2 Unified Implementation Plan

## Executive Summary

This plan outlines the systematic implementation of LawnBerry Pi v2 as a unified autonomous mower system with comprehensive WebUI. The approach prioritizes constitutional compliance, ARM64/Bookworm compatibility, and parallel development opportunities while maintaining safety-first principles throughout.

## Constitutional Framework Compliance

All implementation must adhere to LawnBerry Pi Constitution v1.2.0:

- **Platform Exclusivity**: ARM64/Raspberry Pi OS Bookworm only
- **Python Version**: 3.11+ (no Python 3.9 in main environment)
- **Package Restrictions**: No pycoral, edgetpu, or tensorflow in main environment
- **AI Acceleration**: Isolated hierarchy (Coral USB → Hailo HAT → CPU fallback)
- **Hardware Configuration**: INA3221 channels (1:Battery, 2:Unused, 3:Solar)
- **GPS Mode Exclusivity**: RTK USB primary, UART fallback only
- **Resource Management**: Proper timeouts, cancellation, cleanup protocols

## Phase Overview

### Phase 1: Constitutional Foundation (Tasks 1-7)
**Duration**: 2-3 weeks  
**Focus**: Core infrastructure with constitutional compliance

### Phase 2: Hardware Integration (Tasks 8-14) 
**Duration**: 3-4 weeks  
**Focus**: Sensor systems and hardware abstraction

### Phase 3: Autonomous Systems (Tasks 15-24)
**Duration**: 4-5 weeks  
**Focus**: Navigation, safety, and mowing intelligence

### Phase 4: WebUI & Integration (Tasks 25-31)
**Duration**: 2-3 weeks  
**Focus**: User interfaces and system integration

## Implementation Strategy

### Constitutional Compliance Checkpoints

Each task includes mandatory constitutional validation:

1. **Package Isolation Verification**
   ```bash
   # Verify main environment clean of banned packages
   venv/bin/python -c "import pkgutil; banned = ['pycoral', 'edgetpu', 'tensorflow']; found = [p for p in banned if pkgutil.find_loader(p)]; print('VIOLATION:' + str(found) if found else 'COMPLIANT')"
   ```

2. **Platform Compatibility Testing**
   ```bash
   # Verify ARM64/Bookworm compatibility
   uname -m | grep -q aarch64 || echo "PLATFORM_VIOLATION"
   python3 --version | grep -q "3.11" || echo "VERSION_VIOLATION"
   ```

3. **Hardware Configuration Validation**
   ```bash
   # Verify constitutional hardware assignments
   timeout 30s venv/bin/python -c "from src.hardware import validate_constitutional_config; validate_constitutional_config()"
   ```

### Parallel Development Opportunities

**Track A - Core Infrastructure** (Can run in parallel):
- Task 1: Constitutional compliance framework
- Task 2: Core data structures  
- Task 3: Hardware abstraction layer
- Task 4: Configuration management

**Track B - Communication Layer** (Can run in parallel):
- Task 5: WebSocket hub (already completed)
- Task 6: Event system (already completed)
- Task 7: REST API foundation (already completed)

**Track C - Safety Systems** (Sequential dependency on Track A):
- Task 15: Emergency stop system
- Task 16: Tilt detection
- Task 17: Obstacle avoidance
- Task 18: Safety state machine

### Risk Mitigation Strategies

#### Hardware Compatibility Risks
- **Early Validation**: Test all sensor integrations on target hardware before software development
- **Fallback Paths**: Implement simulation modes for all hardware interfaces
- **Timeout Enforcement**: All hardware operations must include timeout protections

#### Constitutional Violations
- **Automated Checks**: CI/CD pipeline validates constitutional compliance on every commit
- **Package Monitoring**: Runtime checks prevent banned package imports
- **Environment Isolation**: Coral/TPU operations strictly isolated in separate environment

#### Development Dependencies
- **Mocking Strategy**: Comprehensive hardware mocks for development without physical devices
- **Incremental Testing**: Each component tested independently before integration
- **Rollback Plans**: Version control strategy allows immediate rollback of breaking changes

test -f venv_coral_pyenv/bin/activate || { echo "Coral venv missing"; exit 1; }

# Package isolation verification  
venv/bin/python -c "import sys; banned=['pycoral','edgetpu','tensorflow']; any(p for p in sys.modules if any(b in p for b in banned)) and exit(1) or print('CLEAN')"

# Platform verification
[[ "$(uname -m)" == "aarch64" ]] || { echo "ARM64 required"; exit 1; }
