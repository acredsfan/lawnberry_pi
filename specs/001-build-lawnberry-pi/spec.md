## User Scenarios & Testing

### Primary User Story
A user wants to operate an autonomous robotic lawn mower that can navigate their property, avoid obstacles, maintain safety protocols, and provide real-time monitoring and control capabilities through a web interface. The system should handle all aspects of autonomous mowing operations including sensor data processing, navigation planning, motor control, safety monitoring, power management, and visual feedback.

### Acceptance Scenarios
1. **Given** the mower is powered on and positioned on a lawn, **When** the user initiates mowing through the web interface, **Then** the system autonomously navigates and mows the designated area while avoiding obstacles
2. **Given** the mower is operating autonomously, **When** an obstacle or safety hazard is detected, **Then** the system immediately stops motors and alerts the user through the web interface
3. **Given** the user opens the web interface, **When** the mower is operating, **Then** real-time telemetry data (position, battery, sensor readings, camera feed) is displayed
4. **Given** the mower battery is low, **When** the threshold is reached, **Then** the system autonomously returns to charging station and notifies user
5. **Given** a user has LawnBerry Pi v1, **When** they follow the migration process, **Then** they can successfully upgrade to v2 with preserved settings

### Edge Cases
- What happens when GPS signal is lost during navigation?
- How does the system handle sensor failures or inconsistent readings?
- What occurs when Wi-Fi connectivity is interrupted during field operations where Ethernet is unavailable?
- How does the system respond to weather conditions or wet grass?
- What happens during emergency stop scenarios?

## Clarifications

### Session 2025-09-24
- Q: What boards/OS/Python are supported? ‚Üí A: Raspberry Pi OS Bookworm 64-bit; Python 3.11.x; Pi 5 (primary) and Pi 4B (compatible).
- Q: GPS configurations? ‚Üí A: Either (a) ZED-F9P RTK over USB with NTRIP (preferred) or (b) Neo-8M over UART (alternative, no RTK). Not both at once.
- Q: Drive controller options? ‚Üí A: Preferred: RoboHAT RP2040 ‚Üí Cytron MDDRC10 (PWM, encoders, safety IO). Alternative: L298N dual H-bridge if RoboHAT isn‚Äôt available.
- Q: HAT stacking policy? ‚Üí A: Do not combine RoboHAT and Hailo HAT simultaneously. GPIO splitter use is unsupported/at-your-own-risk and not in the main build path.
- Q: AI acceleration order and isolation? ‚Üí A: Coral USB (isolated venv-coral) ‚Üí Hailo HAT (optional) ‚Üí CPU (TFLite/OpenCV). BAN `pycoral`/`edgetpu` in the main env.
- Q: Sensors, buses, and addresses? ‚Üí A: BNO085 on UART4; VL53L0X left 0x29, right 0x30; BME280 0x76; SSD1306 0x3C; INA3221 0x40.
- Q: INA3221 fixed channel mapping? ‚Üí A: Channel 1 = Battery; Channel 2 = Unused; Channel 3 = Solar.
- Q: Networking assumptions? ‚Üí A: Wi-Fi primary; Ethernet is bench-only and must not be assumed at runtime.
- Q: Cutting system details? ‚Üí A: IBT-4 H-Bridge, GPIO24/25, with tilt/e-stop safety interlocks.
- Q: Camera/UI? ‚Üí A: Picamera2 ‚Üí GStreamer; retro 80s WebUI; must run well on Pi 5 and degrade gracefully on Pi 4.
- Q: RC receiver? ‚Üí A: FUTURE feature only; document RoboHAT inputs in docs/optional-hardware.md; do not implement now.
- Q: Simulation and CI? ‚Üí A: SIM_MODE=1 drivers for GPS/IMU/BME280/ToF/blade/motors/power; CI runs sim tests; hardware-in-loop later on the mower Pi.

## Requirements

### Functional Requirements
- **FR-001**: System MUST collect and process sensor data including IMU positioning (BNO085 on UART4), power monitoring (INA3221 at 0x40), distance measurements (VL53L0X at 0x29/0x30), environmental data (BME280 at 0x76), display telemetry (SSD1306 at 0x3C), and wheel encoder feedback
- **FR-002**: System MUST plan and execute autonomous navigation paths while avoiding static and dynamic obstacles
- **FR-003**: System MUST control motor operations for propulsion and cutting mechanisms with precise speed and direction control
- **FR-004**: System MUST implement safety protocols including emergency stops, obstacle avoidance, and hazard detection
- **FR-005**: System MUST monitor power consumption and battery levels with automated charging station return, using INA3221 with Channel 1 assigned to battery, Channel 2 unused, and Channel 3 for solar input
- **FR-006**: System MUST capture and stream video feed for visual monitoring and AI-based obstacle detection via Picamera2 pipelines delivered over GStreamer
- **FR-007**: System MUST provide web-based user interface for monitoring, control, and configuration that delivers an intentional retro 1980s aesthetic, operates fluidly on Raspberry Pi 5, and degrades gracefully on Raspberry Pi 4
- **FR-008**: System MUST run AI processing for object detection and navigation assistance with hardware acceleration support, prioritizing Coral USB (isolated `venv-coral`), then optional Hailo HAT, and finally CPU-based TFLite/OpenCV while keeping `pycoral`/`edgetpu` packages out of the main environment
- **FR-009**: System MUST maintain real-time bidirectional communication between all system components via centralized message hub, relying on Wi-Fi for field operations and reserving Ethernet for bench diagnostics only
- **FR-010**: System MUST persist operational data, user settings, and historical performance metrics
- **FR-011**: System MUST provide automated installation and configuration scripts for deployment
- **FR-012**: System MUST operate as managed system services with automatic startup and monitoring

- **FR-014**: System MUST provide complete documentation including user guides, API references, and operational procedures
- **FR-015**: System MUST support migration from LawnBerry Pi v1 installations with data preservation

### Key Entities

- **Navigation State**: Current position, planned path, obstacle map, and movement commands with safety constraints
- **Motor Control**: Speed settings, direction commands, and operational status for propulsion (RoboHAT RP2040 with Cytron MDDRC10, or fallback L298N) and cutting systems (IBT-4 H-Bridge on GPIO24/25 with tilt and e-stop interlocks)
- **Safety Events**: Emergency conditions, obstacle detections, and system alerts with priority levels and response actions
- **Power Management**: Battery levels, consumption patterns, charging status, and power optimization settings tied to INA3221 Channel 1 (battery), Channel 2 (unused reserve), and Channel 3 (solar)

- **System Configuration**: Operational parameters, calibration data, and user-defined settings with version tracking, capturing GPS mode (ZED-F9P RTK via USB or Neo-8M via UART‚Äîmutually exclusive) and network assumptions (Wi-Fi primary, Ethernet bench-only)
- **Telemetry Data**: Consolidated system metrics, performance indicators, and operational logs for monitoring and analysis, including simulation results and CI artifacts from `SIM_MODE=1` runs
