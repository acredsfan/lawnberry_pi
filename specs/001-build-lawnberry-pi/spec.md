## User Scenarios & Testing

### Primary User Story
A user wants to operate an autonomous robotic lawn mower that can navigate their property, avoid obstacles, maintain safety protocols, and provide real-time monitoring and control capabilities through a web interface. The system should handle all aspects of autonomous mowing operations including sensor data processing, navigation planning, motor control, safety monitoring, power management, and visual feedback.

### Acceptance Scenarios
1. **Given** the mower is powered on and positioned on a lawn, **When** the user initiates mowing through the web interface, **Then** the system autonomously navigates and mows the designated area while avoiding obstacles
2. **Given** the mower is operating autonomously, **When** an obstacle or safety hazard is detected, **Then** the system immediately stops motors and alerts the user through the web interface
3. **Given** the user opens the web interface, **When** the mower is operating, **Then** real-time telemetry data (position, battery, sensor readings, camera feed) is displayed
4. **Given** the mower battery is low, **When** the threshold is reached, **Then** the system autonomously returns to charging station and notifies user
5. **Given** a user has LawnBerry Pi v1, **When** they follow the migration process, **Then** they can successfully upgrade to v2 with preserved settings

### Edge Cases
- What happens when GPS signal is lost during navigation?
- How does the system handle sensor failures or inconsistent readings?
- What occurs when network connectivity is interrupted?
- How does the system respond to weather conditions or wet grass?
- What happens during emergency stop scenarios?
