# Feature Specification: WebUI Page & Hardware Alignment Update

**Feature Branch**: `002-update-spec-to`  
**Created**: 2025-09-24  
**Status**: Draft  
**Input**: User description: "Update spec to explicitly list the seven WebUI pages and their goals, require matching REST/WS contracts, and align hardware section with updated hardware.yaml."

## Execution Flow (main)
```
1. Parse user description from Input
	→ If empty: ERROR "No feature description provided"
2. Extract key concepts from description
	→ Identify: actors, actions, data, constraints
3. For each unclear aspect:
	→ Mark with [NEEDS CLARIFICATION: specific question]
4. Fill User Scenarios & Testing section
	→ If no clear user flow: ERROR "Cannot determine user scenarios"
5. Generate Functional Requirements
	→ Each requirement must be testable
	→ Mark ambiguous requirements
6. Identify Key Entities (if data involved)
7. Run Review Checklist
	→ If any [NEEDS CLARIFICATION]: WARN "Spec has uncertainties"
	→ If implementation details found: ERROR "Remove tech details"
8. Return: SUCCESS (spec ready for planning)
```

## User Scenarios & Testing *(mandatory)*

### Primary User Story
Operations staff managing the LawnBerry mower need a single specification that documents every required WebUI page, the data each view must surface, and the matching service contracts and hardware expectations so that development teams can implement and validate the experience without ambiguity.

### Acceptance Scenarios
1. **Given** the specification is reviewed, **When** stakeholders check the WebUI section, **Then** all seven mandated pages (`Dashboard`, `Map Setup`, `Manual Control`, `Mow Planning`, `AI Training`, `Settings`, `Docs Hub`) are called out with their high-level goals.
2. **Given** the specification, **When** backend and QA teams look up service expectations, **Then** the document references REST and WebSocket contracts that must line up with each page's data needs and mentions the telemetry cadence for real-time updates.
3. **Given** the specification, **When** hardware leads compare platform requirements, **Then** the listed devices, buses, and prioritization rules match the authoritative hardware manifest for the project.

### Edge Cases
- What happens when optional hardware (e.g., alternative GPS or AI accelerator) is unavailable? The spec must describe expected fallbacks while staying faithful to the hardware manifest.
- How does the system handle simulated mode requirements? The spec should confirm simulation coverage for each WebUI view and contract.
- How are conflicting hardware accessories (e.g., Hailo hat with RoboHAT) communicated? The spec must carry over explicit conflict notes from the hardware manifest.

## Requirements *(mandatory)*

### Functional Requirements
- **FR-001**: Specification MUST describe the `Dashboard` page goal as delivering live mower state, safety status, and headline KPIs at a glance.
- **FR-002**: Specification MUST describe the `Map Setup` page goal as defining yard boundaries, mowing zones, and exclusion regions, including how changes surface through matching REST and WebSocket updates.
- **FR-003**: Specification MUST describe the `Manual Control` page goal as enabling direct drive and blade actions with safety indicators and observable feedback from real-time streams.
- **FR-004**: Specification MUST describe the `Mow Planning` page goal as managing schedules, job queues, and progress tracking with related data feeds.
- **FR-005**: Specification MUST describe the `AI Training` page goal as reviewing captured imagery, labeling data, and exporting datasets, along with the contracts supporting uploads and approvals.
- **FR-006**: Specification MUST describe the `Settings` page goal as configuring mower preferences, hardware selections, networking, and simulation toggles while calling out required persistence contracts.
- **FR-007**: Specification MUST describe the `Docs Hub` page goal as bundling on-device documentation, troubleshooting, and compliance references consistent with branding requirements.
- **FR-008**: Specification MUST require that each WebUI page references the REST endpoints and WebSocket topics that supply its data, including snapshot frequency or broadcast expectations for telemetry-oriented pages.
- **FR-009**: Specification MUST align hardware details (platform, sensors, controllers, power monitoring, acceleration hierarchy) with the authoritative hardware manifest, including preferred vs. alternative components and any operational constraints or conflicts.
- **FR-010**: Specification MUST restate that simulated operation covers sensors, navigation, power, and AI pipelines so that every listed page and contract can be validated without physical hardware.
- **FR-011**: Specification MUST highlight monitoring expectations for safety-critical data (e.g., INA3221 channel map, emergency stop signals) to ensure UI pages and contracts expose alerts when thresholds are exceeded.

### Key Entities *(include if feature involves data)*
- **WebUI Page Contract**: Describes each of the seven mandated pages, the primary objective of the view, and the data/command flows it depends on via REST or WebSocket channels.
- **Hardware Baseline**: Captures required vs. optional hardware components (Raspberry Pi models, GPS modules, sensors, power monitoring, drive systems, AI accelerators) and their constraints so the specification remains synchronized with the hardware manifest.
- **Telemetry Exchange**: Summarizes the snapshot data, event notifications, and job updates that the system must publish to satisfy the dashboard, planning, and safety monitoring experiences.
