## Execution Flow (main)
```
1. Parse user description from Input
   ‚Üí If empty: ERROR "No feature description provided"
2. Extract key concepts from description
   ‚Üí Identify: actors, actions, data, constraints
3. For each unclear aspect:
   ‚Üí Mark with [NEEDS CLARIFICATION: specific question]
4. Fill User Scenarios & Testing section
   ‚Üí If no clear user flow: ERROR "Cannot determine user scenarios"
5. Generate Functional Requirements
   ‚Üí Each requirement must be testable
   ‚Üí Mark ambiguous requirements
6. Identify Key Entities (if data involved)
7. Run Review Checklist
   ‚Üí If any [NEEDS CLARIFICATION]: WARN "Spec has uncertainties"
   ‚Üí If implementation details found: ERROR "Remove tech details"
8. Return: SUCCESS (spec ready for planning)
```

## ‚ö° Quick Guidelines
- ‚úÖ Focus on WHAT users need and WHY
- ‚ùå Avoid HOW to implement (no tech stack, APIs, code structure)
- üë• Written for business stakeholders, not developers

### Section Requirements
- **Mandatory sections**: Must be completed for every feature
- **Optional sections**: Include only when relevant to the feature
- When a section doesn't apply, remove it entirely (don't leave as "N/A")

### For AI Generation
When creating this spec from a user prompt:
1. **Mark all ambiguities**: Use [NEEDS CLARIFICATION: specific question] for any assumption you'd need to make
2. **Don't guess**: If the prompt doesn't specify something (e.g., "login system" without auth method), mark it
3. **Think like a tester**: Every vague requirement should fail the "testable and unambiguous" checklist item
4. **Common underspecified areas**:
   - User types and permissions
   - Data retention/deletion policies  
   - Performance targets and scale
   - Error handling behaviors
   - Integration requirements
   - Security/compliance needs

## User Scenarios & Testing *(mandatory)*

### Primary User Story
As an operator using a Raspberry Pi 5‚Äìpowered LawnBerry mower, I want to run the system with real hardware (not simulation) so that I can drive, mow, and monitor the mower via the Web UI and CLI with reliable, safety‚Äëenforced behavior.

### Acceptance Scenarios
1. **Given** the mower is powered on with all listed hardware connected, **When** I start the backend and frontend and open the Web UI, **Then** I can enable motors, drive forward/backward/turn, and see live camera and key telemetry (GPS, IMU tilt, ToF distances, battery/solar power).
2. **Given** the blade is off, **When** I enable the blade in the UI with safety conditions satisfied (no excessive tilt, adequate voltage), **Then** the blade engages and can be stopped from the UI or by emergency stop.
3. **Given** the mower is driving, **When** a tilt exceeds 30 degrees or an obstacle is detected within 0.18 m by any ToF, **Then** the system immediately (‚â§200 ms) stops the blade and commands motor stop.
4. **Given** the system is in real (non‚ÄëSIM) mode, **When** the Google Coral accelerator is connected, **Then** AI processing status reports Coral as the active accelerator; when absent, **Then** system continues without blocking mower operation.
5. **Given** hall sensors are connected to RoboHAT, **When** the mower moves 1 m forward on level ground, **Then** encoder feedback reflects expected tick counts and the UI shows motion updates.

### Edge Cases
- Loss of any single sensor (e.g., one ToF or IMU) must degrade gracefully and preserve safe operation (blade inhibited if tilt unknown).
- GPS not fixed (no RTK) must not block manual driving but should show reduced accuracy.
- Low battery voltage threshold must inhibit blade and alert the operator.
- Serial or I2C bus busy conditions must not freeze control loops; commands must still time out to stop motors.
- Camera unavailable should not block the rest of the system; the UI shows a camera error but control remains available.

## Requirements *(mandatory)*

### Functional Requirements
- **FR-001**: The system MUST operate outside simulation mode by default when running on deployed hardware (Raspberry Pi 5).
- **FR-002**: The operator MUST be able to drive the mower (differential drive) via Web UI and CLI with latency suitable for manual control.
- **FR-003**: The blade motor MUST be controllable (enable/disable) via Web UI and CLI, subject to safety interlocks.
- **FR-004**: The system MUST read live telemetry from: IMU (tilt/yaw), ToF distance sensors (two units, left/right), environmental (temperature, humidity, pressure), GPS (u‚Äëblox RTK‚Äëcapable), power (battery and solar via INA3221), hall sensors (wheel encoders), and camera.
- **FR-005**: Safety MUST cut blade power within 200 ms when tilt exceeds 30¬∞ roll or pitch, on obstacle within 0.18 m, or on emergency stop activation.
- **FR-006**: The system MUST gracefully degrade when any sensor is unavailable (missing, unplugged, driver error) and MUST log the condition visibly in the UI.
- **FR-007**: The system MUST allow operation when the Google Coral accelerator is absent and MUST automatically use it when present.
- **FR-008**: The operator MUST be able to see real‚Äëtime camera stream and essential telemetry values in the Web UI.
- **FR-009**: The CLI MUST support commands to start/stop motors, engage/disengage blade, perform emergency stop, and query health/telemetry.
- **FR-010**: The system MUST provide a health status endpoint that reflects connectivity to RoboHAT/MDDRC10, IMU, ToF x2, BME280, GPS (RTK‚Äë9FP), INA3221, camera, Coral.
- **FR-011**: Hall sensor feedback (encoders) MUST update while driving and be exposed for UI display and navigation.
- **FR-012**: Configuration MUST allow selecting real hardware vs. simulation explicitly and per‚Äëcomponent overrides.
- **FR-013**: Logs MUST record hardware faults, safety interlocks, and operator actions for later review.
- **FR-014**: The mower MUST fail safe: on hardware or software fault, motors and blade are stopped.
- **FR-015**: The system MUST present clear operator messages to avoid misinterpretation, with frequent explicit grounding (e.g., "No IMU data; blade disabled").

*Examples of unclear details to confirm:*
- **FR-016**: System MUST define exact low‚Äëvoltage thresholds and hysteresis for blade inhibit [NEEDS CLARIFICATION: exact voltage/current thresholds requested?].
- **FR-017**: System MUST define required GPS fix quality to allow autonomous features [NEEDS CLARIFICATION: is manual only sufficient for this scope?].
- **FR-018**: System MUST define acceptable command latency targets for drive and blade control [NEEDS CLARIFICATION: target ms?].

### Key Entities *(include if feature involves data)*
- **Operator session**: User interaction context via Web UI/CLI.
- **Hardware telemetry**: Structured data for GPS, IMU, ToF (left/right), environment, power, encoders, camera status.
- **Safety interlocks**: Emergency stop state, tilt cutoff, obstacle inhibit, low‚Äëvoltage inhibit.
