# This is a placeholder for a TensorFlow Lite model file
# In a real implementation, this would be a binary model file
# generated by the training script or converted from TensorFlow
# 
# To create an actual model, run:
# python models/custom/train_lawn_model.py
#
# This file serves as a placeholder to demonstrate the TPU integration
# and model loading capabilities of the system.
