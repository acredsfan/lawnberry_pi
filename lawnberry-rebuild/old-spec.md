## User Scenarios & Testing

### Primary User Story
A user wants to operate an autonomous robotic lawn mower through a comprehensive web interface that provides real-time monitoring, manual control, autonomous operation planning, AI-powered obstacle detection, and system configuration. The system must handle all aspects of autonomous mowing operations while ensuring safety, providing visual feedback, and maintaining operational efficiency across varying hardware configurations and environmental conditions.

### Acceptance Scenarios

#### Core Autonomous Operation
1. **Given** the mower is powered on and positioned on a lawn, **When** the user initiates mowing through the web interface, **Then** the system autonomously navigates and mows the designated area while avoiding obstacles and maintaining safety protocols
2. **Given** the mower is operating autonomously, **When** an obstacle or safety hazard is detected, **Then** the system immediately stops motors, activates safety protocols, and alerts the user through the web interface with specific hazard information
3. **Given** the mower battery reaches a low threshold, **When** power management triggers energy-conserving behavior, **Then** the system autonomously navigates to the most appropriate location based on time-of-day and sun availability ‚Äî the "AM Sun" location in morning hours, the "PM Sun" location in afternoon hours, or the user-defined "Home" location otherwise ‚Äî and notifies the user of the charge/idle status (no physical docking station)

#### WebUI Experience & Control
4. **Given** the user opens the web interface Dashboard, **When** the mower is operating, **Then** real-time telemetry data (position, battery, sensor readings, safety status, camera feed) is displayed with <100ms latency and 5Hz update frequency
5. **Given** the user accesses Manual Control with proper authentication, **When** direct commands are issued, **Then** the system responds immediately with visual feedback and safety override capabilities
6. **Given** the user configures mowing zones in Map Setup, **When** boundaries and exclusion areas are defined with a polygon drawing tool, **Then** the system validates the configuration and updates navigation parameters in real time. The map uses Google Maps as the preferred provider (with usage optimized to keep API costs negligible) and OpenStreetMap as a selectable fallback. The mower‚Äôs live position is shown using the LawnBerry map pin asset (LawnBerryPi_Pin.png).
7. **Given** the user schedules jobs in Mow Planning, **When** jobs are queued and executed, **Then** progress updates stream live with estimated completion times and zone-specific status
8. **Given** the user reviews captured imagery in AI Training, **When** datasets are labeled and exported, **Then** the system generates both COCO JSON and YOLO TXT formats for downstream processing

#### Hardware & Platform Compliance
9. **Given** the system runs on Raspberry Pi 5 or Pi 4B with Raspberry Pi OS Bookworm, **When** hardware detection occurs, **Then** the system correctly identifies and configures sensors, GPS (ZED-F9P USB or Neo-8M UART), and motor controllers (RoboHAT‚ÜíCytron MDDRC10 or L298N fallback)
10. **Given** AI acceleration hardware is available, **When** object detection runs, **Then** the system prioritizes Coral USB (isolated venv), then Hailo HAT, then CPU fallback while maintaining constitutional package isolation
11. **Given** power monitoring via INA3221, **When** system operates, **Then** Channel 1 tracks battery, Channel 2 remains unused, and Channel 3 monitors solar input per constitutional requirements

#### Migration & Maintenance
12. **Given** a user has LawnBerry Pi v1, **When** they follow the migration process, **Then** they can successfully upgrade to v2 with preserved settings and minimal operational disruption

### Edge Cases
- What happens when GPS signal is lost during navigation and system must rely on IMU/encoder dead reckoning?
- How does the system handle sensor failures or inconsistent readings while maintaining operational safety?
- What occurs when Wi-Fi connectivity is interrupted during field operations (Ethernet unavailable per constitution)?
- How does the system respond to weather conditions, wet grass, or environmental hazards?
- What happens during emergency stop scenarios from multiple sources (tilt, manual, obstacle)?
- How does the WebUI handle degraded performance on Pi 4B vs Pi 5?
- What occurs when optional hardware (Hailo HAT, alternative GPS) is unavailable?
- How does simulation mode provide complete coverage for CI/testing without hardware?
