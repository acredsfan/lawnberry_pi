# LawnBerryPi Coral TPU Dependencies
#
# IMPORTANT: These packages are for FALLBACK installation only!
# Primary installation method for Pi OS Bookworm is system packages:
#   sudo apt-get install python3-pycoral python3-tflite-runtime
#
# These pip packages should only be used when:
# 1. System packages are not available
# 2. Installation script fallback is triggered
# 3. Development/testing on non-Pi systems
#
# Compatibility Notes:
# - pycoral pip packages are NOT available for Python 3.11+ on ARM64
# - These work primarily on x86_64 systems for development
# - Pi OS Bookworm users should use system packages exclusively
# - Official Coral support targets Python 3.9 via pyenv (see README for setup)

# Coral Edge TPU Runtime (fallback for non-Bookworm systems)
