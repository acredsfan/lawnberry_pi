# LawnBerry Remote-Access Stability Spec

## §G — Goal

Remote UI at `lawnberry.link-smart-home.com` stays reachable and functional
across WiFi roaming events and cloudflared restarts. No manual intervention needed.

---

## §C — Constraints

- Hardware: Raspberry Pi 5, wlan1 = external antenna (primary), wlan0 = internal (fallback)
- WiFi: 5 GHz mesh "Link_IoT"; gateway varies by AP (192.168.4.1 / 192.168.50.1 / 192.168.86.1)
- Cloudflare tunnel token fixed in systemd unit; tunnel ID `cc06f475-a8e0-4418-a40d-1e3445d6cf8f`
- Frontend served by Vite dev server on :3000 (proxies `/api/*` incl. WebSocket to :8081)
- Backend FastAPI/uvicorn on :8081
- No hardware available in agent sessions (`SIM_MODE=1` for tests)
- Must not break local-network access or existing backend behaviour

## §I — External Surfaces

| ID | Surface | Details |
|----|---------|---------|
| I.cf | Cloudflare tunnel | `lawnberry.link-smart-home.com` → `http://localhost:3000` |
| I.ssh | SSH tunnels | `lawnberry-ssh` + `mower-ssh` → `tcp/ssh://localhost:22` |
| I.fe | Frontend | Vite dev server :3000, proxies `/api` to :8081 with `ws:true` |
| I.api | Backend REST | FastAPI :8081 `/api/v2/*` |
| I.ws | Backend WebSocket | `ws[s]://<origin>/api/v2/ws/telemetry` + `/api/v2/ws/control` |
| I.wdog | WiFi watchdog | `/opt/wifi-watchdog`, config `/etc/wifi-watchdog/watchdog.yml` |

---

## §V — Invariants

| ID | Invariant |
|----|-----------|
| V1 | `cloudflared.service` must have `Restart=always` and NO `WatchdogSec` — cloudflared 2026.3.0 does not reliably send sd_notify heartbeats; WatchdogSec kills it every 120 s |
| V2 | `wifi-watchdog.service` must have `Type=simple` — `Type=notify` causes systemd to SIGTERM the process every ~90 s when sd_notify READY is never sent |
| V3 | WiFi watchdog ping list must contain NO hardcoded gateway IPs — gateway varies per AP; must be auto-detected from `ip route show dev wlan1` at runtime |
| V4 | WiFi watchdog escalation must skip disabled tiers rather than stalling — stalling means `cycle_interface`, `reset_usb_device`, and `reboot` are never reachable |
| V5 | WebSocket client `maxReconnectAttempts` must be -1 (unlimited) — a finite cap means the UI permanently breaks after N cloudflared restarts without a page reload |
| V6 | WebSocket reconnect backoff must cap at ≤ 30 s — prevents multi-minute gaps after a burst of drops |
| V7 | `ping -W` argument must be ≥ 1 — `int(800/1000) = 0` disables the timeout, causing each probe to hang until subprocess timeout |
| V8 | cloudflared tunnel must expose BOTH `:3000` (frontend) for HTTP AND have WebSocket upgrade support — Vite proxy handles WS upgrade from `/api/v2/ws/*` to :8081 only when `ws:true` is set in vite.config.ts |

## §T — Tasks

| id | status | description | cites |
|----|--------|-------------|-------|
| T1 | ✓ done | `Type=notify` → `Type=simple` in wifi-watchdog.service | V2 |
| T2 | ✓ done | Fix ping gateway: auto-detect via `get_default_gateway()` in connectivity.py | V3 |
| T3 | ✓ done | Fix escalation skip-disabled bug in escalation.py | V4 |
| T4 | ✓ done | Fix `ping -W 0` → `max(1, …)` in connectivity.py | V7 |
| T5 | ✓ done | Add `Restart=always` to cloudflared.service | V1 |
| T6 | ✓ done | Remove `WatchdogSec=120s` from cloudflared.service | V1 |
| T7 | ✓ done | Set `maxReconnectAttempts = -1` and cap backoff at 30 s in websocket.ts | V5, V6 |
| T8 | . | Verify Vite `ws:true` proxy survives Cloudflare's HTTP upgrade path; add integration smoke-test | V8, I.cf |
| T9 | . | Add wifi-watchdog unit test: assert disabled tier is skipped, not stalling | V4 |
| T10 | ✓ done | Commit and push all service-file + watchdog source changes made today | V1–V4, V7 |

## §B — Bug Log

| id | date | cause | fix |
|----|------|-------|-----|
| B1 | 2026-05-12 | `Type=notify` in wifi-watchdog.service; Python never sends sd_notify READY → systemd SIGTERM loop every ~90 s | V2, T1 |
| B2 | 2026-05-12 | Hardcoded gateway `192.168.50.1` always unreachable → watchdog permanently LOST, never fires recovery | V3, T2 |
| B3 | 2026-05-12 | Escalation `maybe_escalate` returned None on disabled tier without advancing index → `cycle_interface`/`reboot` unreachable | V4, T3 |
| B4 | 2026-05-12 | `int(800/1000) = 0` passed to `ping -W` → per-host probe had no timeout | V7, T4 |
| B5 | 2026-05-12 | cloudflared process stayed alive after losing all QUIC connections; `Restart=on-failure` never triggered | V1, T5 |
| B6 | 2026-05-12 | `WatchdogSec=120s` added to cloudflared.service; cloudflared 2026.3.0 stops sending watchdog pings after startup → SIGABRT every 2 min | V1, T6 |
| B7 | 2026-05-12 | `maxReconnectAttempts=5`; after burst of cloudflared crashes the WS client gives up permanently → UI broken until hard-reload | V5, T7 |
